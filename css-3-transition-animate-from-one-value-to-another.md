title: CSS 3: Animate or transition from one css value to another
tags: css

To transition from one css value to another, you can use the `transition` attribute.

In your element, set the value you want to transition, with the time taken to do such: `transition: flex-basis 0.3s;` for example.

And the change `flex-basis` value somehow to see the transition, usually by changing either class or style property of an element.

You can change the type of transition by setting the `transition-timing-function` attribute: to `ease-in-out` for example.
