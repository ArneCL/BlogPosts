     Ctrl+E: Quickly change to an open file with autocomplete
     Ctrl+F7: Quickly change / activate a view (Editor, package inspector, etc)
     Ctrl+F8: Quickly change perspective
     Alt+(left/right): Go to previous / former position or file.

Navigating source code

     F3: Go to definition of method under the cursor
     Ctrl+O: Show the class overview, with autocomplete
     (pressing it again shows the inherited methods) 

Refactoring:

     Ctrl+1: Open the quick refactoring menu
     Ctrl+Alt+R: Rename a method / variable
     Ctrl+Alt+M: Move the highlighted code out into an extracted method
     Ctrl+Alt+L: Refactor selected text into a local variable
     Ctrl+Alt+O: Organise imports (delete unused etc)

Debugging

     Ctrl+Shift+B: Add a breakpoint to the current line
     F11: Debug last thing debugged
     F5: Step into method (while debugging)
     F6: Step over line (while debugging)
     F8: Resume (while debugging)

Running:

     (must set in Preferences -> Run/Debug -> Always launch previously launched activity)
