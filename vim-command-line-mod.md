title: Vim: command line mode
tags: vim,unix

First `set -o vi` and you can press escape (or whatever you'd bound that to) to use the vim commands on the current commanded typed in on the command line.

You can also press `v` and it will open up vim and you can edit the command in the full vim editor. 

You made need to put `EDITOR=vim` in your `.bashrc` file.
