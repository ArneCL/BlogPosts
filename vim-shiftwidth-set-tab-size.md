title: Vim: Change tabs to spaces and set how many spaces on tab press
tags: vim

When you press tab in vim, you normally get a tab character inserted in your text.

You can turn this off via `set expandtab`. When you press tab now, you get spaces.

To alter how many spaces you get on tab press, issue `set tabstop=4`.

Finally, to alter how to spaces you get when you indent text with `>`, issue `set shiftwidth=4`.
