title: Use html to order a border with a title around things
tags: css,html

You can group items with a border in HTML using `fieldset` and you can also give that border a title using `legend`.

The title breaks the border briefly at the top.

Here's an example which you can use to impress your friends, family, dogs, cats and potential parliamentary representatives.

```
<fieldset style="border: 1px dashed black">
  <legend>Ladies and gentlemen we are floating in space</legend>
  Sup
</fieldset>
```
